# WordGuess-Cli
Constructor based Word Guess Cli Game

Task
Using two objects, Letter and Word, make a Hangman-style word guess game. When invoked from command line, pick a random word, display placeholders for the letters. Prompt the player for letter guesses. If correct, display the word with placeholders filled in. If incorrect, reduce the number of incorrect guesses remaining.

Concepts and technologies
- Node.js, command-line applications
- NPM for JS library management
- Custom Node.js modules
- Inquirer.js for interactive prompting
- Object constructor functions (optionally could assign methods via prototypes)
- Object-oriented design
- Recursion for the prompt cycle (though using Inquirer's rxjs foundation could be more elegant)
- Asynchronous programming

Role
- Creator
